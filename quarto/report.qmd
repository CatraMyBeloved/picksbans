## Introduction

This document aims to analyse the hero selection by teams in the first three weeks of OWCS. The data is taken from the wonderful [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRTkWc3-NK0HtsOjipS8cqYMJRTddCSgecM-KD4wbNSpdjDJcpaYt-E-N8jU6j13CefwHGZ3I22SV-x/pubhtml) published by CommanderX. This report was written on the 27th of February, but should be able to always access the most recent data.
